## What I Did

- Built a dashboard that shows time spent on activities like Work, Play, Study, etc.
- Used `fetch()` to load data from a JSON file and display it on the page.
- Made each activity show current and previous hours for daily, weekly, or monthly views.
- Added buttons to switch between time ranges.
- Styled the layout with CSS to make it clean and colorful.
