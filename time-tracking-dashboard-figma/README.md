## What I Did

- Built a dashboard that shows time spent on activities like Work, Play, Study, etc.
- Used `fetch()` to load data from a JSON file and display it on the page.
- Made each activity show current and previous hours for daily, weekly, or monthly views.
- Added buttons to switch between time ranges.
- Styled the layout with CSS to make it clean and colorful.

## Updates

- **Nov 19, 2025**  
  Cleaned up the JavaScript and used `fetch()` to load JSON data. Tested time range switching and card rendering.

- **Nov 18, 2025**  
  Set up the HTML, CSS, and JSON file. Got the basic layout and card rendering working.
